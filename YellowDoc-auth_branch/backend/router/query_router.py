"""Retrieval endpoints.

``rag_search`` was ``async def`` but called straight into synchronous retrieval —
an embedding pass plus a Groq round trip — so every question blocked the event
loop for its full duration. All three handlers now run their work in a thread.

``/query/documents`` and ``/query/reindex`` are new: the front end needs to know
what is searchable before it can let the user scope a question to one file.
